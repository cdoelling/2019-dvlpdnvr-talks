## Creating a Deep Learning Algorithm to Play Pong

During this special live stream at Develop Denver I (mostly) wrote a deep learning algorithm to play a game of pong versus a classis ai. We didn't get through all of the functions, and unfortunately the deep learning algorithm lost the game.

I stream on Twitch.tv on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays as I learn new things. Come join and say hi!
